# Sudoku Solver

A simple brute-force sudoku solver written in python (3.x) to show how you might use recursion to solve a sudoku.

Based on the Computerphile YouTube video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_UYXzGuqvM

I have rationalised the code, and commented it to explain how it works. I also removed any reliances on external libraries.

Have fun :)
